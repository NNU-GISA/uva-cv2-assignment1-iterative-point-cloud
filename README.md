# CV2_Assignment1

## Implementation

### point selection techniques
- [x] all the points
- [ ] uniform sub-sampling
- [ ] random sub-sampling in each iteration
- [ ] sub-sampling more from informative regions
    - how to map regions back to points?

### analyze
- [ ] accuracy
- [ ] speed
- [ ] stability: changes in magnitude of R and t
- [ ] tolerance to noise
